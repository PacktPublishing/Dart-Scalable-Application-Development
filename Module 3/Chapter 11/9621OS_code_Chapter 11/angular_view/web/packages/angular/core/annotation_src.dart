  /**
   * Use map to define the mapping of  DOM attributes to fields.
   * The map's key is the DOM attribute name (DOM attribute is in dash-case).
   * The Map's value consists of a mode prefix followed by an expression.
   * The destination expression will be evaluated against the instance of the
   * directive / component class.
   *
   * * `@` - Map the DOM attribute string. The attribute string will be taken
   *   literally or interpolated if it contains binding {{}} systax and assigned
   *   to the expression. (cost: 0 watches)
   *
   * * `=>` - Treat the DOM attribute value as an expression. Set up a watch,
   *   which will read the expression in the attribute and assign the value
   *   to destination expression. (cost: 1 watch)
   *
   * * `<=>` - Treat the DOM attribute value as an expression. Set up a watch
   *   on both outside as well as component scope to keep the src and
   *   destination in sync. (cost: 2 watches)
   *
   * * `=>!` - Treat the DOM attribute value as an expression. Set up a one time
   *   watch on expression. Once the expression turns truthy it will no longer
   *   update. (cost: 1 watches until not null, then 0 watches)
   *
   * * `&` - Treat the DOM attribute value as an expression. Assign a closure
   *   function into the field. This allows the component to control
   *   the invocation of the closure. This is useful for passing
   *   expressions into controllers which act like callbacks. (cost: 0 watches)
   *
   * Example:
   *
   *     <my-component title="Hello {{username}}"
   *                   selection="selectedItem"
   *                   on-selection-change="doSomething()">
   *
   *     @Component(
   *       selector: 'my-component'
   *       map: const {
   *         'title': '@title',
   *         'selection': '<=>currentItem',
   *         'on-selection-change': '&onChange'})
   *     class MyComponent {
   *       String title;
   *       var currentItem;
   *       ParsedFn onChange;
   *     }
   *
   *  The above example shows how all three mapping modes are used.
   *
   *  * `@title` maps the title DOM attribute to the controller `title`
   *    field. Notice that this maps the content of the attribute, which
   *    means that it can be used with `{{}}` interpolation.
   *
   *  * `<=>currentItem` maps the expression (in this case the `selectedItem`
   *    in the current scope into the `currentItem` in the controller. Notice
   *    that mapping is bi-directional. A change either in field or on
   *    parent scope will result in change to the other.
   *
   *  * `&onChange` maps the expression into the controller `onChange`
   *    field. The result of mapping is a callable function which can be
   *    invoked at any time by the controller. The invocation of the
   *    callable function will result in the expression `doSomething()` to
   *    be executed in the parent context.
